A) Unlike proprietary software, OSS is collaborative, community-oriented and community-driven. So from a business point of view: 
    1. OSS has ower dependence on manufacturers, better negotiating position
    2. OSS often has high code quality
    3. OSS has greater employer attractiveness, motivation for employees

B) Contributing to OSS has high switching costs due to vendor lock-in, and there might be missing features or no suitable open source solutions. Sometimes there is few providers for the open source tools, and hardly any advertising for open source software.

C) In OSS, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and starts independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. 

 A friendly fork is a fork that does not intend to compete, but wants to eventually merge with the original. While unfriendly fork doesn't. Forking is important for open source communities because a central freedom of OSS is what keeps communities vibrant and companies honest.
